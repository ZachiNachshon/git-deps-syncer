## Tooling setup

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is required for running/debugging the executable
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is optional for managing the documentation site

{{< callout info >}}
Docs site is using npm scripts to build the documentation and compile source files. The `package.json` houses these scripts which used for various docs development actions.

## Guidelines

- PRs need to have a clear description of the problem they are solving
- PRs should be small
- Code without tests is not accepted, PRs must not reduce tests coverage
- Contributions must not add additional dependencies
- Before creating a PR, make sure your code is well formatted, abstractions are named properly and design is simple
- In case your contribution can't comply with any of the above please start a GitHub issue for discussion

## Testing Locally

Running tests locally allows you to have short validation cycles instead of waiting for the PR status to complete.

**How to run a test suite?**

1. Clone the `git-deps-syncer` repository
2. Run `make tests` to run the tests suite

## Documentation Scripts

The `/docs-site/package.json` includes numerous tasks for developing the documentation site. Run `npm run` to see all the available npm scripts in your terminal. Primary tasks include:

{{< bs-table >}}
| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run docs-build` | Cleans the Hugo destination directory for a fresh serve |
| `npm run docs-serve` | Builds and runs the documentation locally |
| `npm run docs-serve-lan` | Builds and runs the documentation locally, make it available on home network<br> (for testing views on mobile phones) |
{{< /bs-table >}}

## Local documentation 

Running our documentation locally requires the use of Hugo, which gets installed via the `hugo-bin` npm package. Hugo is a blazingly fast and quite extensible static site generator. Hereâ€™s how to get it started:

- Run through the [tooling setup](#tooling-setup) above to install all dependencies
- Navigate to `/docs-site` directory and run `npm install` to install local dependencies listed in `package.json`
- From `/docs-site` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line
- Open [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/) in your browser

Learn more about using Hugo by reading its [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

## Troubleshooting

In case you encounter problems with missing dependencies, run `make align-deps`.
